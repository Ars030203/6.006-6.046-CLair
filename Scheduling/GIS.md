#Interval scheduling 
The Interval Scheduling Problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science. It involves selecting the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals from a given set of intervals. Each interval is represented by a tuple containing the start and end time of the interval.

The goal of the Interval Scheduling Problem is to find the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals that can be selected from the given set of intervals. This problem is often encountered in scheduling problems where we need to schedule a set of events or tasks with given start and end times.

In this document, we will discuss how to solve the Interval Scheduling Problem using the greedy algorithm in Python.

The Greedy Algorithm
The greedy algorithm is a simple yet powerful algorithmic paradigm that makes the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. In the case of the Interval Scheduling Problem, we can use the greedy algorithm to select the intervals in a way that maximizes the number of non-overlapping intervals.

The greedy algorithm for the Interval Scheduling Problem works as follows:

Sort the intervals by end time in ascending order.
Initialize the count of non-overlapping intervals and the end time of the last selected interval.
Iterate over all intervals:
a. If the start time of the current interval is greater than or equal to the end time of the last selected interval, select the current interval and update the last end time.
Return the count of non-overlapping intervals.
The intuition behind the greedy algorithm is that by selecting the intervals with the earliest end time, we free up the maximum amount of time for the remaining intervals to be selected. Therefore, we can select the maximum number of intervals without overlapping.
